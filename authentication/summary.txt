The salted version was 1250 times slower, since we couldn't
pre-hash the dictionary and compare the hashes and had to salt
and re-hash them for each different salt, which required us to
iterate through, on average, half of the dicitonary for each 
password that we were attempting to crack, rather than just 
once in the entire process for the unsalted passwords.
